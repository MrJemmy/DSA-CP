## Notes 
- A void pointer is a general-purpose pointer that can hold the address of any data type, but it is not associated with any data type. -> `void *ptr`
- Suppose we have declared a pointer 'ptr', and now, we want to de-allocate its memory. -> `free(ptr);` - used for C. 
- Aggregation (HAS-A relationship)  :- *`class A` has pointer, which is pointing to `class B`* this is Aggregation.
